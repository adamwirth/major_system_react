# Major System

The technique known as the "Major System", invented in the seventeenth century by Johann Winkelmann, is a conversion code to convert numbers into phonetic sounds. Those sounds can then be turned into words, which can in turn become images for a memory palace. The code works like the following...

| # | Char     |
|---|----------|
| 0 | S        |
| 1 | T or D   |
| 2 | N        |
| 3 | M        |
| 4 | R        |
| 5 | L        |
| 6 | Sh or Ch |
| 7 | K or G   |
| 8 | F or V   |
| 9 | P or B   |


To create meaningful words, you can freely intersperse vowels, just not the consonants.

Examples:

- 32 → **MN** → **M**a**n**
- 33 → **MM** → **Mom**
- 86 → **FSh → F**i**sh**
- 3219 → 32 + 19 → **MN** + **TB** → **M**a**n** [with a] **t**u**b**a

Shout-out to the book *Moonwalking with Einstein* for introducing me to this system. It's neat.
