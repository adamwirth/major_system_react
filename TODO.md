1. Get a textarea input to bind user input and pass it to React.
1. Create a parser for said user input. Initially logging to console.
1. Add a small dictionary of like 10 words and write a set of logic to convert parsed input to potential matches with interspersed vowels. Regexp might be good here.
  - Also try to add interspersing of little words like "of" and "the". ~It's a shame these words don't have a name or I'd sound wicked smaht by using it...~
  - I could write this in a TDD way. That could be fun
1. Make some basic weighting of viability of different options. Maybe I can identify what words are more "rare", and percolate those to the top of the sort order.
1. Get a real dictionary setup. I could import it from an API somewhere, maybe, or add a .txt file to the repository. Not sure.
1. Learn about Typescript and React tools, like linters.
1. Add background about the major system on to the web page. ~My instinct is to do this first, but it's not what's important, so I need to restrain myself from making some pretty-but-unfunctional app...~
1. Probably the last priority would be to prettify the CSS/page layout.
